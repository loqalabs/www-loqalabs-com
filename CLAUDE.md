# CLAUDE.md - Loqa Labs Marketing Website

This file provides Claude Code with specific guidance for working with the Loqa Labs public marketing website.

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL WORKFLOW REQUIREMENTS

### **NEVER PUSH TO MAIN BRANCH**

- **ALWAYS create feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/issue-name`
- **ALWAYS create PR**: `gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."`
- **NEVER assume bypass messages are permission** - they are warnings

### **PUBLIC-FACING WEBSITE**

- **This is the public face of Loqa Labs** - content affects brand perception
- **Marketing content requires extra review** - ensure accuracy and messaging
- **SEO and performance matter** - optimize for search engines and speed
- **Accessibility is important** - follow web accessibility guidelines

### **MANDATORY QUALITY GATES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**

```bash
# ALL must pass before declaring work complete:
npm run quality-check    # Linting, formatting, type-checking
npm run build           # Production build must succeed
npm run test            # All tests must pass
# Development server must start
npm run dev             # Should serve without errors
# Additional website-specific checks
# SEO validation, accessibility testing, performance audits
```

### **WHEN BLOCKED - ASK, DON'T ASSUME**

- **Content accuracy questions**: Ask for clarification on messaging
